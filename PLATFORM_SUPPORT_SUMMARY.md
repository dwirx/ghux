## 🧪 Test Results

### Latest Test Run (2025-01-XX)

All platforms tested successfully with SSH authentication:

```
✓ GitHub    - Exit code: 1 (normal) - "Hi dwirx! You've successfully authenticated"
✓ GitLab    - Exit code: 0 - "Welcome to GitLab, @podsni0!"
✓ Bitbucket - Exit code: 0 - "authenticated via ssh key"
✓ Gitea     - Exit code: 0 - "Hi there, podsni! You've successfully authenticated"
```

### SSH Config Verification

All platforms have correct entries in `~/.ssh/config`:

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Success Pattern Recognition

GhUx recognizes these patterns as successful SSH authentication:

```regex
/successfully authenticated|Hi\s+.+! You've successfully authenticated|Welcome to GitLab|logged in as|authenticated via|You can use git|Hi there,/i
```

This regex matches:
- ✅ GitHub: "Hi username! You've successfully authenticated"
- ✅ GitLab: "Welcome to GitLab"
- ✅ Bitbucket: "authenticated via" and "You can use git"
- ✅ Gitea: "Hi there," and "successfully authenticated"
- ✅ Generic: "logged in as"

### Platform Detection

GhUx auto-detects platform from git remote URL:

```typescript
// Examples:
git@github.com:user/repo.git       → GitHub
git@gitlab.com:user/repo.git       → GitLab
git@bitbucket.org:user/repo.git    → Bitbucket
git@gitea.com:user/repo.git        → Gitea
git@gitlab.company.com:user/repo   → GitLab (custom domain)
```

### SSH Config Generation

Each platform gets correct SSH config block:

```ssh-config
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /path/to/github_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes

Host gitlab.com
  HostName gitlab.com
  User git
  IdentityFile /path/to/gitlab_key
  IdentitiesOnly yes
```

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Adding Accounts for Each Platform

```bash
# GitHub Account
ghux
→ Add new account
→ SSH
→ GitHub
→ Enter name: github-work
→ Configure SSH key...

# GitLab Account (gitlab.com)
ghux
→ Add new account
→ SSH
→ GitLab
→ Is this a custom domain? No
→ Configure key...

# GitLab Self-Hosted
ghux
→ Add new account
→ SSH
→ GitLab
→ Is this a custom domain? Yes
→ Enter domain: gitlab.company.com
→ Configure key...

# Bitbucket Account
ghux
→ Add new account
→ SSH
→ Bitbucket
→ Configure key...

# Gitea Self-Hosted
ghux
→ Add new account
→ SSH
→ Gitea
→ Is this a custom domain? Yes
→ Enter domain: gitea.yourcompany.com
→ Configure key...
```

### Testing Connections

```bash
# Test specific account
ghux
→ Test connection
→ Select account

# Or use health check for all accounts
ghux health
```

### Switching Between Platforms

```bash
# In a GitHub repo, switch to GitLab
cd ~/my-project
ghux
→ Switch for current repo
→ Select GitLab account
# Remote URL changed from github.com to gitlab.com

# Set global default
ghux
→ Switch SSH globally
→ Select preferred account
```
